Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll detail a simple way of converting C437 PNGs to the format Raylib expects.
Raylib is a wonderful library for writing quick and simple GUI applications, especially games. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for about a year on various prototypes, most recently a roguelike in Zig. While Raylib&amp;rsquo;s text rendering is generally good, I wanted to be able to use old-school fonts using the Code page 437 character set.</description></item><item><title>Principles for Automated and Reproducible Benchmarking</title><link>https://example.com/publications/2023_sc23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/publications/2023_sc23/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Years as a trustee of SocRSE UK; A retrospective</title><link>https://example.com/presentations/2023_rse_retrospective/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/presentations/2023_rse_retrospective/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Xclim; xarray-based climate data</title><link>https://example.com/publications/2023_xclim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/publications/2023_xclim/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Role of Heterogeneous Computing on the Expressway to Net Zero Compute</title><link>https://example.com/presentations/2023_power_efficient_hpc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/presentations/2023_power_efficient_hpc/</guid><description/></item><item><title>An Introduction to FPGAs</title><link>https://example.com/presentations/2022_fpgas_excalibur/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/presentations/2022_fpgas_excalibur/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Flute and kink instabilities in a dynamically twisted flux tube with anisotropic plasma viscosity</title><link>https://example.com/publications/2021_khi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/publications/2021_khi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>GPU-Accelerated Spectral Methods in Python; A Case Study</title><link>https://example.com/presentations/2021_melvin_septembrse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/presentations/2021_melvin_septembrse/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and collapse of a twisted magnetic null point with anisotropic viscosity</title><link>https://example.com/publications/2022_flute_instability/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/publications/2022_flute_instability/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Accelerated Python for CFD</title><link>https://example.com/presentations/2021-scot-fluid-melvin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/presentations/2021-scot-fluid-melvin/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Analysing the prevalence of continuous integration in JOSS</title><link>https://example.com/analysing-the-prevalence-of-continuous-integration-in-joss/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 18:42:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/analysing-the-prevalence-of-continuous-integration-in-joss/</guid><description>JOSS is the Journal of Open Source Software and can be considered a collection of some excellent scientific codebases.

It can be challenging to absorb so many different good practices while still getting research done. However, I would argue that anything helps. While all good practices in open science are important, even just incorporating one example is good for the community, and provides a solid personal foundation for gradually incorporating more good practices.</description></item><item><title>How to Render Latex in Inkscape</title><link>https://example.com/how-to-render-latex-in-inkscape/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 16:45:05 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/how-to-render-latex-in-inkscape/</guid><description>Rendering latex equations or text in the graphics package Inkscape is not an intuitive task, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create an extremely short tutorial on doing exactly that using Inkscape&amp;rsquo;s in-built latex extesion.

Now a professor emeritus at the University of Texas, and a visiting associate at the Institute for Advanced Study, Uhlenbeck&amp;rsquo;s work has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics, with implications in theoretical physics.
Despite describing Einstein&amp;rsquo;s general relativity as &amp;ldquo;too hard&amp;rdquo;, in a single paper, Uhlenbeck is considered to have founded the field of geometric analysis, a mathematical discipline that mixes differential geometry (an extremely technical way of describing and analysing the nature of spaces) and differential equations (types of complicated equations that can describe the flow of water, the evolution of bacteria and fluctuations in the stock market).</description></item><item><title>UGRacing Ahead</title><link>https://example.com/ugracing-ahead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 20:16:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/ugracing-ahead/</guid><description>Just a short while ago I had the pleasure of spending an afternoon with the University of Glasgow Racing team, found either in their cosy, computer filled office in the James Watt South, or nestled in their garage, deep in the bowels of the Rankine.

He Jiankui, from the Southern University of Science and Technology of China, genetically altered the DNA of multiple embryos using the gene-editing technique CRISPR in order to disable the CCR5 gene, thought to be responsible for vulnerability to HIV.
Disable the gene in a person and they can be theoretically immune to the disease. This sounds like a wonderful use of modern technology, allowing people with HIV to safely have children.</description></item><item><title>The falsehood of the PhD pedestal</title><link>https://example.com/the-falsehood-of-the-phd-pedestal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:40:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/the-falsehood-of-the-phd-pedestal/</guid><description>The British government, in introducing the new doctoral loans offered to graduates aiming for a PhD, have sent out a message â âPhDs are valuableâ.

The Maths You can find lots of information about Julia fractals all around the web so I won&amp;rsquo;t go into much detail at all here. All I&amp;rsquo;ll say is that the fractals, named for Gaston Julia, come about by iterating a complex number through the formula $$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c,$$ where \(c\) is some complex number.</description></item><item><title>Braginskii magnetohydrodynamics for arbitrary magnetic topologies; coronal applications</title><link>https://example.com/publications/2017_braginskii/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/publications/2017_braginskii/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Regularly Expressional Fractalations</title><link>https://example.com/regularly-expressional-fractalations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/regularly-expressional-fractalations/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s something about fractals that humans find fascinating. They manage to contain a beautiful impression of infinity despite being not very difficult to create. These fractals have been produced by a very simple recipe:
Split a big square of pixels into 4 quadrants and label them 1 to 4 Repeat this process for each of the smaller squares and add the quadrant number to the label Keep cutting the squares into 4 until you&amp;rsquo;ve gone as small as you want Now we can use regular expressions to find and mark boxes with certain labels I wrote a little bit of javascript that creates such fractals from regular expressions involving the digits 1, 2, 3 or 4.</description></item><item><title>How I lost a Day to OpenMPI Being Mental</title><link>https://example.com/how-i-lost-a-day-to-openmpi-being-mental/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2017 13:28:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/how-i-lost-a-day-to-openmpi-being-mental/</guid><description>So at Glasgow Uni we have this little cluster for the maths department which happens to including about ten machines set up to work with torque (a job scheduling system).

For one thing, many of the simulations come under the category of high performance computing (HPC) simulations, so it can take a long time to build and run a test case, leading to iteration speeds that are painfully slow.</description></item><item><title>Anisotropic Viscosity in MHD; Heating Profiles About Coronal Null Points</title><link>https://example.com/presentations/2017-ukmhd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/presentations/2017-ukmhd/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Parallelising Wondrous Numbers in C++</title><link>https://example.com/parallelising-wondrous-numbers-in-c-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/parallelising-wondrous-numbers-in-c-/</guid><description>The Collatz conjecture, named for Lothar Collatz, goes as follows.
Take any positive integer \(n\). If \(n\) is even, half it, or if it&amp;rsquo;s odd, multiply it by three and add one. Repeating the process will always bring you back to 1.
The sequence of numbers generated by repeating the process is sometimes called the hailstone sequence due to the strange way the sequence bounces around, as you can see below if we start the sequence at 19.</description></item><item><title>Mathematics in Art</title><link>https://example.com/presentations/2017-math-in-art/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/presentations/2017-math-in-art/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Making of the Fiddle Synth I</title><link>https://example.com/the-making-of-the-fiddle-synth-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/the-making-of-the-fiddle-synth-i/</guid><description>My idea for a violin synthesizer came about from a Lau concert I recently went to.

Building PCs, networking them together and setting up servers and chat bots for friends was a key part of being a teenager for me. Of course I was interested in hacking as well; which wee nerd isn&amp;rsquo;t. Luckily I stopped being interested after gaining some useful skills but before getting into any (serious) trouble. I eventually got into programming through playing with Arduino boards, a great introduction to both basic electronics and low-level embedded programming.</description></item></channel></rss>
