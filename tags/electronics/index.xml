Before the concert there were a few different workshops, one of which was a synthesizer making workshop run by Martin Green, the accordion player from Lau. Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t make it along, but I did manage to see the concert where he uses synthesizers in just the right places to create an amazing deep sound.</description></item></channel></rss>
