I was about eleven.
Then, there was the Wordpress blog (or maybe Blogger). I was probably about thirteen.
After that came the social networks, Myspace, Bebo, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and then I decided I needed an actual blog for some reason. In my naivety I went for a full blown CMS stack, Mezzanine, a Django project. It took about a week solid, buying server space, setting up the entire site, finding a theme, tweaking the theme, breaking the theme, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
