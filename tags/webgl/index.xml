Really when I say GPU programming I mean using general purpose tech like CUDA, but CUDA and WebGL are similar enough (the boilerplate is of course totally different but the idea of writing a kernel to act on many pixels/fluid cells is the same).</description></item><item><title>Mr. Julia</title><link>https://example.com/mr.-julia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/mr.-julia/</guid><description>Going on my theme of wonderfully fractal images, I wrote a little simulation to introduce myself to webGL. Go have a wee play about with it here.
The Maths You can find lots of information about Julia fractals all around the web so I won&amp;rsquo;t go into much detail at all here. All I&amp;rsquo;ll say is that the fractals, named for Gaston Julia, come about by iterating a complex number through the formula $$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c,$$ where \(c\) is some complex number.</description></item></channel></rss>
