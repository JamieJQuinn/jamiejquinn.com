I was about eleven.</p><p>Then, there was the Wordpress blog (or maybe Blogger). I was probably about thirteen.</p><p>After that came the social networks, Myspace, Bebo, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and then I decided I needed an actual blog for some reason. In my naivety I went for a full blown CMS stack, Mezzanine, a Django project. It took about a week solid, buying server space, setting up the entire site, finding a theme, tweaking the theme, breaking the theme, etc. I didn&rsquo;t post a single thing.</p><p>Finally today I decided I would knuckle down, build a nice <em>simple</em> blog and actually post to it. I feel like I&rsquo;ve actually got things to say now, things about maths and programming and the different projects I&rsquo;ve done over the last few years. But I needed to keep it simple. Enter Jekyll.</p><h3 id=jekyll>Jekyll</h3><p>I&rsquo;d heard about Jekyll when I was last researching how I might want to build my blog. It basically works in the same way as large scale CMS&rsquo;s like Wordpress and Django-CMS by using templates to serve up information like blog posts. While CMSs typically store their information in a database and interact with it as the user needs it, Jekyll is a static site generator, meaning all the information is stored in (typically) markdown files and then the entire site generated as a static site. When I first thought of doing a blog, Jekyll seemed too simple, maybe a bit inflexible without an interactive client-server thing going on. Having over the last 12 hours built the blog in a <em>day</em>, I can say that I was wrong and the thing that took the longest was actually settling on a theme (because there are a <a href=jekyllthemes.io>lot</a>).</p><p>There is a good reason why I like Jekyll now. It is to blogs what a cafetiere is to coffee makers. Sure, you could go down the route of buying a fancy electric coffee maker that automatically grinds the beans and makes you coffee that&rsquo;s ready just before you knew you wanted it, and that might be exactly what&rsquo;s needed for an office. I mean can you imagine thirty people using the same cafetiere? But what if it&rsquo;s just you, and you don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> know how fancy coffee makers work, and you don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> have the time to figure them out, and you frankly just want some coffee? Why would you go for the option that&rsquo;s overkill?</p><p>Although the analogy to the coffee makers is a bit tongue-in-cheek, hopefully you can appreciate where I&rsquo;m coming from in that, for a simple blog, Jekyll is all I need. As a plus, I haven&rsquo;t spent a thing on hosting or domain names this time around since I&rsquo;ve decided that <a href=https://pages.github.com/>Github Pages</a>, with its free hosting and domain name, is absolutely fine.</p><p>The workflow I&rsquo;ve settled on begins with modifying a local version of the site, which I set up following the Github Pages <a href=https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/>tutorial</a>. I can test it by running from the site root directory the command</p><pre><code>jekyll serve
</code></pre><p>and checking that the site is working fine in my browser. Then I simply push the changes to github and usually within minutes the site is live.</p><h3 id=minimal-mistakes>Minimal Mistakes</h3><p>Once I&rsquo;d settled on Jekyll, I had to find a theme to base my design on. I&rsquo;m no web designer so I worked primarily by finding a base theme, <a href=http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/>Minimal Mistakes</a> by Michael Rose, then looking through blogs that I like the look of and trying to emulate the bits that I really liked. For instance, I felt that posts needed something to make major headings stand out a little more, to really highlight separate sections. I didn&rsquo;t want to use lines across the page, so after seeing the little solid bars to the left of the headings in <a href=http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html#motivation>Game Programming Patterns</a>, I went ahead and implemented them. It looks a little clunky still in my opinion so I&rsquo;ll probably change it later, but in keeping with my simple philosophy for the rest of the site-building project, it&rsquo;ll do for my needs right now.</p></content><p><a href=https://jamiejquinn.com/tags/code/>#Code</a>
