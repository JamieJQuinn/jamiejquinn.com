**Hi, I'm Jamie Quinn**. I'm a software engineer, applied mathematician and fiddle player. Originally from Clydebank, near Glasgow, Scotland, I'm currently based in Bletchley of [Bletchley Park](https://www.tnmoc.org/)!

If you like technical writing on science, technology and particularly simulation software, check out my [blog](/blog). If you're interested in fluids dynamics, high-performance computing, numerical methods, GPU programming or simulation, check out my [projects](/projects). If you like art, I make algorithms that make [images I call art](/art). If you are a masochist, maybe check out my [driest writing available](/publications) or even my PhD thesis, [Modelling anisotropic viscosity with applications in the solar corona](/thesis.pdf). I also maintain a log of the [more interesting presentations I've given](/presentations).

I also play fiddle as part of a duo with my partner Annie. Here's a recording of one of our (not so recent) gigs at Celtic Connections in Glasgow:

Perhaps you like watching swirly motions, such as the formation of a thermohaline staircase. This particular kind of simulation took days on a large supercomputer 20 years ago. I simulated this in hours on a single GPU *using Python*:
