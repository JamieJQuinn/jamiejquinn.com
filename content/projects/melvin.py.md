        A pseudospectral solver framework designed to simulate 2-dimensional advection-diffusion problems. It is written entirely in Python and leverages CuPy for GPU parallelisation. It has been used to simulate thermohaline staircase formation, Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection, and the resistive tearing instability.
